Introduction
============

Onion is the web client for Ascribe. The idea is to have a well documented,
easy to test, easy to hack, JavaScript application.

The code is JavaScript ECMA 6.


Getting started
===============

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:ascribe/onion.git
cd onion
npm install
npm run watch
```

Code Conventions
============
For this project, we're using:

* 4 Spaces
* We use ES6
* We don't use ES6's class declaration because it does not support Mixins as well as Autobinding ([Blog post about it](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#autobinding))
